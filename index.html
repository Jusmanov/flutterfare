        <h1>Comparing common transportation costs in NYC</h1>
        <p>Flutterfare compares cost estimates for different modes of transportation (only for NYC) based on fare information provided by the NYC Taxi & Limousine Commission and citibike. Users can adjust various factors that determine the cost of either medium of transport such as time of ride, type of bike, etc.</p>

        <h1>What is Flutterfare?</h1>
        <p class = "hero-text-p">With various ways to go around New York City, one may want to weigh their transportation options based on price range, time efficiency, safety, and accessibility. Flutterfare is a website designed to present and compare these options, currently limited to citibike and yellow cab taxis with support for the NYC metro system (MTA data) arriving by 2025. It was created in 2024 by John Usmanov, once an NY resident.</p>

            <li>A citibike can get a rider to a destination (at shorter distances) faster than a taxi can during rush hour (4-8pm on weekdays). Taxis also have higher costs during rush hour.</li>
            <li>Citibikes are ideal for shorter ranges, no more than 5-10 miles. Longer rides warrant taking a taxi, bus, or the metro.</li>

            <li>Taxis in NYC are safe- drivers have been screened and taxi accidents are minimal.</li>
            <li>Taxis are easy to find because of their high abundance within the city. For this reason, a rider doesn't have to follow a strict schedule to get on a taxi- there's much flexibility.</li>
            <li>During rush hour, taxis can be inconvenient due to the slowing of traffic and the $2.50 rush hour surcharge. In this case, a citibike might be better.</li>

            <li>NYC's metro is much faster than other transportation methods like cars (and taxis) and citibikes, especially over longer distances.</li>
            <li>Unlike citibikes or taxis, it won't just be you riding. The MTA's bus and metro system ridership is around 5 million people total.</li>
