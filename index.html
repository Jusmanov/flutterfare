        <h1>Comparing common transportation costs in NYC</h1>
        <p>Flutterfare compares cost estimates for different modes of transportation (only for NYC) based on fare information provided by the NYC Taxi & Limousine Commission, citibike, and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA). Users can adjust various factors that determine the cost of either medium of transport such as time of ride, type of bike, etc.</p>

        <h1>What is Flutterfare?</h1>
        <p class = "hero-text-p">With various ways to go around New York City, one may want to weigh their transportation options based on price range, time efficiency, safety, and accessibility. Flutterfare is a website designed to present and compare these options, currently limited to citibike, yellow taxis, and MTA rides. It was created in 2024 by John Usmanov, once an NY resident.</p>

            <li>During rush hour, taxis can be inconvenient due to the slowing of traffic and the $2.50 rush hour surcharge. In this case, a citibike might be better.</li>
