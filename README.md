## Comparing common transportation costs in NYC

Flutterfare compares cost estimates for different modes of transportation (only for NYC) based on fare information provided by the NYC Taxi & Limousine Commission, citibike, and the MTA. Users can adjust various factors that determine the cost of either medium of transport such as time of ride. Additionally, Flutterfare's functionality extends to maps that detail the locations of NYC's citibike stations and depicts the complex metro and bus systems of the city.

## Technologies Used
I used HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript for the website's design and functionality. Leaflet was also used to make the citibike stations map on the site.

## Future Plans
- More transportation options to compare to
- More maps
- Advertise/promote site
- Improve price estimation algorithms
